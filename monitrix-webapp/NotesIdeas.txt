Notes & Ideas
=============


Crawl log auto-discovery
------------------------

Go to all https://crawler01.bl.uk:8443/engine/job/annual-08051000

and look for

    loggerModule.crawlLogPath: crawl.log
    /heritrix/output/logs/annual-08051000/20130807132026/crawl.log

OR go through

    https://crawler01.bl.uk:8443/engine/anypath/heritrix/output/logs/

Tricky part is that checkpointing moves files, so probably need to store the hash of the first part to marry up known log files with new locations. See https://crawler01.bl.uk:8443/engine/anypath/heritrix/output/logs/annual-08051000/20130807132026/

Cassandra
---------

Install it, e.g. http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/1.2/webhelp/index.html#cassandra/install/installRHEL_t.html


TODO
----

* Tables for crawl_id level graphs, e.g. compressibility, etc. Start with ingest code, then searchers, then viewers.
* Compressibility, build histogram directly.
* List alerts on hostinfo page.
* Add domain-level page, linking to related hosts (subdomains).
* Fix paging on search page(s).
* Swap crawl-caps over to be alerts (oart done, as crawl caps are logged as alerts).
* Strip annotations out at the API level.
